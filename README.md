# Askify

It specifically uses the Gemini AI language model, enabling users to pose questions or prompts and receive responses. Askify leverages the capabilities of Gemini AI to provide insightful and context-aware answers, making it a versatile tool for various natural language processing tasks.

## Usage Steps

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where your Python script (`genai_cli.py`) is located. Use the `cd` command to change directories.
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   If you are using a virtual environment, activate it. If not, you can skip this step.
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Unix-based systems
   venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows

3. **Run the Program:**
   ```bash
   python genai_cli.py

 If you have set up an alias, you can use that instead.
 ```bash
 run_my_project
